# seasonal-product-discounter

In this project I had to imitate a clothing shop.
The shop has different sales going by the product's color or by the specific season.
The shop has different offers on the different items by the discounts.
I had to simulate a day in the shop.
The shop has items and users which are randomly generated.
I use SQLite to store the users, products and the transactions that have been made.

# Technologies Used
- Java
- JDBC
- SQLite
- Junit

# Overview
The project uses plain java. It is a simulation project, where I simulate a specific scenario.
With this project I practiced the OOP and SOLID principles. I also learned how to use SQL and how to connect with Java.

# Challenges
The biggest challenge to me was to create the different parts that I need to make the simulation work.
Besides that a great challenge was to connect the database with java.

# Setup Instructions
Manual setup:
- Clone the repo
- Run the program from your IDE (You don't need to do any configuration)
